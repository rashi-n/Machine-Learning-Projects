# Machine-Learning-Projects
Restaurant POpularity by NLP Techniques
Objective of this project is to devise a machine learning algorithm based on Natural Language Prediction techniques which is confluence of Artificial Intelligence and linguistics. It involves intelligent analysis of written language. If we have a lot of data written in plain text and want to automatically get some insights from it, we need to use NLP techniques.

    echo "# Machine-Learning-Projects" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/tini27/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
    git push -u origin master
    
 push an existing repository from the command line
     git remote add origin https://github.com/tini27/Machine-Learning-Projects.git
    git push -u origin master
