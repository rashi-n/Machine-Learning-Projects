<B><U>SLR Model</U></B>

This is a linear regression model to show relationship between Age and Salary in a given organization.

<B><U>Success of Ad Campaign by Population Deomgraphics</U></B>

To assess what category of population demographics ( age, gender, salary) may contribute more to success of new product launch here I have used K Nearest Search algorithm technique to predict the analytics.

<B><U>Salary Compensation by Position</U></B>

Objective of this project was to devise a machine learning algorithm to baseline salary negotiations in corporate world using industry standards. Wide range of linear, non-linear regression models like Polynomial Regression model, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression models were developed to check the validity of salary by given position level.

<B><U>Restaurant Popularity by NLP Techniques</U></B>

Objective of this project is to devise a machine learning algorithm based on Natural Language Prediction techniques which is confluence of Artificial Intelligence and linguistics. It involves intelligent analysis of written language. If we have a lot of data written in plain text and want to automatically get some insights from it, we need to use NLP techniques.
