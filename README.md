# Machine-Learning-Projects

Salary Compensation by Position 

Objective of this project was to devise a machine learning algorithm to baseline salary negotiations in corporate world using industry standards. Wide range of linear, non-linear regression models like Polynomial Regression model, Decision Tree and Random Forest Regression models were developed to check the validity of salary by given position level.

Restaurant Popularity by NLP Techniques

Objective of this project is to devise a machine learning algorithm based on Natural Language Prediction techniques which is confluence of Artificial Intelligence and linguistics. It involves intelligent analysis of written language. If we have a lot of data written in plain text and want to automatically get some insights from it, we need to use NLP techniques.
